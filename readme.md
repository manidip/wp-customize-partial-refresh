### 0.6.1 ###
Fix Jetpack plugin support to use new `container` event property.

### 0.6.0 ###
* Introduce formalized `Placement` JS construct.
* Add `sidebar-updated` event.
* Add support for Twenty Thirteen theme's Masonry-built sidebar.

### 0.5.4 ###
* Trigger `partial-content-rendered` on nested partials' containers when parent is refreshed.
* Jetpack: Restrict adding partials to infinity scroll container on `post-load`.

### 0.5.3 ###

* Add support for Jetpack's Twitter Timeline and Contact Info widgets.

### 0.5.1 ###
* Fix broken Ajax in preview by adding missing script dependency for wp-util.
* Add support for plugin loaded via theme (on WordPress.com).
* Ensure that dynamic_sidebar_params filter applies during partials render request.
* Remove unnecessary is_registered_sidebar() which broke nested sidebar stack

### 0.5.0 ###
Complete rewrite utilizing new selective/partial refresh framework. Selective refreshing of nav menus (in core) and widgets (in this plugin) were rewritten to make use of the new framework. Documentation forthcoming.

### 0.4.3 ###
* Fix PHP 5.2 compatibility.
* Fix support for subdirectory installs.

### 0.4.2 ###
